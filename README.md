# Recommendations:

John Wells - Head of Enterprise Architecture at Crown Commercial Service (CCS)
I worked with Jim on CCS's transformation programme. He utilised his extensive knowledge of publishing to help us rethink the way we work, bringing new insights and challenging long-held assumptions within the organisation. 

His views on data and content really give pause for thought about how modern organisations run on their data and his relaxed and engaging style makes working with him an absolute pleasure.

Aaron Scullion - Experienced digital consultant and leader, specialising in media and sport.
Jim is an excellent product manager who delivered measurable benefits and impacts during his time at Eurosport, contributing to the success of the international launch of the Eurosport Player on the BAMTech platform. 

With expertise in data and an ability to apply this in a real world setting, he is an effective operator in any organisation where data is core (or has the potential to be core) to delivery of customer/business-facing products. 

In addition, with great people skills and long-term experience of product organisations and agile development methodologies, Jim builds strong cross-functional relationships fast, and helps emerging teams to gel.
